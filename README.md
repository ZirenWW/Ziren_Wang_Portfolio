# Ziren_Wang_Portfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! Here you will find some of my projects and skills showcased as part of my work in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Finance.

## About Me
I am currently pursuing a Master of Engineering in Mechanical and Industrial Engineering at the University of Toronto. I specialize in Machine Learning, Data Analysis, and Financial Modeling, with a strong foundation in mathematics and statistics.

## Projects
### 1. Electrical Grid Stability Prediction  
- **Goal**:  
  Developed a mathematical model to predict **electrical grid stability** using Linear Regression and Gradient Descent techniques. The project analyzes the **Electrical Grid Stability dataset** (10,000 instances, 12 features) and evaluates the impact of **batch size** and **learning rate** on convergence.

- **Technologies**:  
  Python, NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib  

- **Process**:  
  - **Data Preparation**: Standardized the dataset manually and split into training (80%) and validation (20%) sets.  
  - **Direct Linear Regression**: Solved using the closed-form solution with matrix inversion.  
  - **Gradient Descent**: Implemented Full-batch, Mini-batch, and Stochastic Gradient Descent, with convergence checks and data shuffling after each epoch.  
  - **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Investigated the effect of batch size and learning rate on RMSE and training time.  

- **Results**:  
  - Analyzed RMSE vs. Epoch and RMSE vs. Time for different batch sizes and learning rates.  
  - Achieved optimal convergence with carefully tuned learning rates and batch sizes.  

- **Visualizations**:  
  - Training/Validation RMSE vs. Epoch  
  - Training/Validation RMSE vs. Time  
  - Total Training Time vs. Batch Size
